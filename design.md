## SCRIPT

### TL;DR

You wake up as an SI student in the first week of classes and you have a crush on an e-girl classmate (Isa) that you met in the university's introduction week. She has 7 ex-boyfriends that are obsessed with her. You need to fight them to get closer to her.

### FULL

You wake up as a new SI undergraduate student on EACH - USP.

You need to go to the introduction week in the college. There will be a lot of activities, conversations and parties to go. However, you don't know anyone from the course.

After the pedagio and other fun things that the veterans did, you went to one of the biggest parties of the year: Big Bixos Brasil, on Tatuape. Actually, you don't like parties very much, but you need this to make some new friends and feel less incongruous in your new college.

Then, you arrive at the party. But, you still don't feel comfortable in that mess, so you go to the open bar to get some cachaça and distract yourself from your frustration. The party continues and your shoes are very dirty. You are very drunk and tired of dancing. It's getting late and the place is getting empty slowly.

You talked to a few people, but didn't make any friends. And, the worst part: you didn't kiss any girl. But it's ok. You drank a lot and the ticket was worth enough. Frustrated, you decide to go home, but, then, you see her face for the first time... and what a beautiful face it is: she's a girl with colored hair highlights. She is looking at you, with a corner smile. She tries to not give attention to you. You get a dose of "pinga do grifo" and walk in her direction to start a conversation. You discover that she is, actually, a veteran on the SI course, and her name is ***. She seems to be drunk, like you. But, it doesn't matter: she gives you a kiss. After this moment, you realise that you drank a lot of pinga at the open bar, and needs to vomit. You tell her that you need to go to the bathroom, and you do. But, when you come back, she isn't at the party anymore and you didn't ask for her phone number. Whatever, you get an uber and go back home.

Now its Monday, you are entering EACH at the CPTM gate, the guard asks you for your cusp (USP card), so you have to play a minigame to give it to him.

You run to your class at Titanic and plays the Calculo 1 class minigame (if you lose the minigame Isa gets disappointed and if you win she starts to notice you)

Prompt: where do you want to go today:

- Grass
- gymnasium
- RU
- CB
- SI lab
- library
- cheese

### If you choose the grass

The Djamba man offers you a maryjuana

- accepts? (y / n)
- if you accept -> game over by excess of serothonim
- if you refuse -> bossfight (because he doesn't want to smoke alone)

### If you choose the gymnasium

You ask the athlete where is Isa (she said when would you appear at the DASI voleyball training in the telegram group). He gets jealous and starts a fight.

### If you choose the RU

You and the vegan guy are next to each other at the RU line. You, as always, chooses the non-vegan option as always, he makes a provocation and you two start fighting.

Each juice either gives you a buff or a debuff, so you have to choose the best juice (uva grape)

### If you choose the CB

The Panelas promoter tries to sell you a Panelas ticket, you try to refuse but realizes you need to go there Saturday to defeat him at a great fashion.

You need to do minigames to gather money to afford the ticket.

### If you choose the SI lab

You encounter the SI nerd having a hard time solving a C bug, he asks you for help, if you solve it first try he is insta-killed, but if you don't, the bossfight starts

### If you choose the library

Luiz Hamilton Guidorizzi is there, standing menacingly as he solves 60 calculations per second. You get scared, and try to run away, but he calculates your route and expands his domain (Um curso de cálculo vol. 1). Bossfight starts.

### If you choose the cheese

Oda is transcending at the cheese, levitating, having the time of his life, reaching nirvana, finding the real life One Piece, if you may. You get closer, and as his aura starts to burn your face he notices your presence, which disturbs him from his "queijo moment". Get ready to die.
